# Aim-Game
Test your reflexes using this aim game 
This is basically a super primitive aim game (for now)
I wish to add more functionality later, such as: 
1) being able to restart the game without having to CTR+R :D 
2) being able to lose or to win, which implies certain levels of difficulty, like after a player reaches a certain miss-rate, he automatically loses
or if a player passes a certain number of circles with good enough hit-rate, then he wins.
3) cosmetics like better styles and smoother animations
