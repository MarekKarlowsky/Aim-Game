# Simple--Aim-Game--in-Vanilla-JS-HTML-CSS
Thanks for visiting my Aim Game repository. 
What I wanted to create was a simple 'hit-or-miss' aim game, where you had the ability to toggle the interval at which circles randomly appear and disappear. 
I'm a beginner developer so this game might currently be a bit (or a lot) clunky. But hopefully I'll improve the game soon, as my skills improve.
Also hoping to add features, such as:
1) Level of difficulty selection 
2) Score Tracker 
3) Combo Tracker (BEST combo + CURRENT combo)
